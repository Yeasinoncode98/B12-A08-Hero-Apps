Beyond Snaps, you can share a collection of moments in your 'Story,' which is visible to your friends for 24 hours. The 'Snap Map' lets you see where your friends are and what they're up to (if they choose to share their location), adding a layer of real-world connection to the digital experience.\n\nFor those who prioritize fun and creative communication with their inner circle, Snapchat is the perfect tool. It’s less about public broadcasting and more about sharing personal, in-the-moment experiences. By combining disappearing messages with powerful AR tools and location sharing, Snapchat provides a dynamic and playful way to stay connected.
